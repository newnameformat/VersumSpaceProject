Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and designed for easy hosting on Vercel, it offers a flexible foundation for anyone wanting to present their creative universe online.

The long-term goal is to make this a template that anyone can adapt for their own worlds — whether you're writing novels, building a game universe, or crafting detailed lore.
