## ðŸŒŒ About the Project ![Badge](https://hitscounter.dev/api/hit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnewnameformat%2FVersumSpaceProject&label=Visitors&icon=github&color=%23052c65&message=&style=flat&tz=UTC)
VersumSpace is a solo-built project designed to organize and showcase original worlds, characters, plots, and timelines.
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and designed for easy hosting on Vercel, it offers a flexible foundation for anyone wanting to present their creative universe online.

The long-term goal is to make this a template that anyone can adapt for their own worlds â€” whether you're writing novels, building a game universe, or crafting detailed lore.
