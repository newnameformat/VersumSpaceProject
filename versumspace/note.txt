Hi! I'm so glad you are using the VersumSpace template to get started
on your project! This is a very basic template meant for customization.
This is only the index.html portion, new pages and layouts will be
added as the project moves along. If you need assistance you can 
message me on discord @newnameformatsucks or visit the link below for
full documentation (link can also be found in your index.html page).
