<p>
    There is no about me template for this project. However, I am happy to create one. You can reach out to <br>
    me via discord @ newnameformatsucks; otherwise, feel free to use this space to build your own. Alternatively, <br>
    you can also use <a href="https://carrd.co/build">Carrd</a> to build some unique, simple pages. Here is <a href="https://newnameformat.carrd.co/">mine!</a>
